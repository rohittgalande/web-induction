# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to CynLr

At **CynLr** we are redefining how machines perceive and interact with the physical world. We build **visual object intelligence** â€” enabling robots to see, understand, and manipulate any object like a human would.

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Mission

To make **object-centric manipulation** as easy and scalable as human hand-eye coordination.

We believe the future of automation lies in machines that don't just follow pre-programmed instructions, but **learn and adapt in real-time** â€” from vision.
